        <p>Too many Quilt Tops so Little Time? The majority of
        quilters enjoy the creative process of piecing their
        quilts, however, they dread having to maneuver the layered
        quilt through the throat of their domestic machine to
        “quilt the quilt”.</p>

        <p>A little introduction here, I am Irene Brayne of Brayne
        Waves Quilting. I started sewing over 40 years ago. In 1982
        I graduated Summa Cum Laude (with highest honours) from
        L’Académie Des Couturiers Canadiens in pattern drafting. It
        was an easy progression for me to move from designing
        clothing to designing quilts because quilts are designed to
        lie flat whereas clothing needs to fit the body. A mattress
        that measures 60” by 80” this week will measure the same a
        year from now!</p>

        <p>My longarm machine is an APQS Millennium with a stitch
        regulator so that the stitch length is consistent. I
        searched long and hard before making the decision to
        computerize my longarm. I made the decision to computerize
        when I crossed paths with the IQ system. What is better
        than having a “Brayne” quilt your quilt? How about a Brayne
        with an “IQ”, what a team!</p>

        <p>My past concern with a computerized machine was the
        “mattress cover” look of consistent quilting. Well the IQ
        won me over. It is leaps and bounds beyond the initial
        machines that hit the market. The IQ enables the operator
        to mirror a pantograph by flipping odd and even rows on the
        X or Y axis (high school math has its place in quilting).
        The result is that a “repeating row” can be several rows
        down the quilt versus every row on a hand guided
        pantograph. One of my “claims to fame” when hand guiding my
        longarm was that I would re-draw the edges of the
        pantograph to not quilt off the edge of the quilt top. The
        beauty of the IQ system is that I am able to keep to this
        high standard AND start and finish with full rows due to
        the re-sizing capabilities of the IQ system.</p>

        <p>I love fabrics and quilting gives me a very creative
        outlet to showcase my work. I feel truly blessed to have
        become a longarm quilter. I love taking the pressure of
        “quilting the quilt” off my client's plate and allowing
        them to move on to the next project. Your quilt is
        important to me and I take pride in the quality of my work.
        I can promise you that throughout the process of quilting
        and finishing your treasured quilt top, I will dedicate my
        time and effort to make it a beautiful quilt. <span class=
        "emphasis">Rest assured that your quilt will be handled
        with tender loving care in a smoke-free
        environment.</span></p>
