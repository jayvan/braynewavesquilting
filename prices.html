        <h2>Quilting, Thread, Batting, Backings and Binding</h2>

        <p>This section is by no means comprehensive. Pricing is as
        individual as your quilting choice and the dimensions of
        your quilt top.</p>

        <h2>Quilting:</h2>

        <p>Since there are quilters that have no concept of how
        much it costs to have a quilt quilted, the purpose of this
        section is to “ballpark” the least expensive quilting
        option.</p>

        <p>The least expensive option is an edge to edge design.
        This is a repeated interlocking pattern quilted from one
        side of the quilt to the other, from the top to the bottom.
        It is priced at $3.50 per square foot.</p>

        <p>This is calculated by measuring your quilt width in
        inches and multiplying it by your quilt length in inches
        and dividing it by 144. This number represents the number
        of square feet in your quilt. It is this number that is
        multiplied by $3.50 to obtain the cost of the quilting.</p>

        <p>Other quilting options which would be more expensive
        include an edge to edge design with a separate border
        pattern. I no longer provide full custom quilting. If
        you have a quilt requiring custom quilting I suggest
        contacting your local quilt shop for a referral.</p>

        <p>I have a minimum quilting charge of $50 per quilt;
        however I do not charge a separate set-up or mounting
        fee.</p>

        <p>These prices do not include additional charges for
        thread, batting, pressing, repairs or piecing the backing
        fabric.</p>

        <h2>Thread:</h2>

        <p>I have a large assortment of thread. I carry cotton,
        polyester, mono-poly (not nylon filament) , variegated,
        polyester, glow in the dark and metallic threads. There is
        an additional charge if you want me to use the specialty
        threads and if you want more than 2 colours per quilt</p>

        <h2>Batting:</h2>

        <p>I carry a variety of battings depending on the quilting
        look you prefer. I carry 100% cotton (also in organic when
        available), 80/20 in bleached, unbleached and black, a
        50/50 blend of bamboo and cotton, natural wool batting and
        also a siliconized poly down batting.</p>

        <h2>Backing:</h2>

        <p>Backing is a very personal choice. For wall hangings and
        plain quilts I can provide either bleached or unbleached
        108” wide muslin. I try to maintain an inventory of some
        neutral tone on tone wide fabrics as well as an assortment
        of beautiful 42” wide quilting cottons and flannels. These
        narrower cottons can be pieced with a matching backing seam
        to look like a wide backing.</p>

        <h2>Binding Service Prices:</h2>

        <p>I do not offer machine binding because I believe your
        quilt deserves the traditional finished look of hand
        binding. For the cost of $1.00 / sq ft (same calculation
        that was done to figure out the cost of quilting) I will
        attach your provided binding for you to flip and hand sew
        to the back of your quilt. For $1.25 /sq ft I will create
        the binding from your provided fabric as well as sew the
        binding onto the front of the quilt ready for you to hand
        sew to the back of the quilt.</p>

        <p>Personally I prefer a wider binding. I cut my bindings 3
        ¼ ” wide resulting in ½” wide binding on the finished
        quilt. To ensure that the complete binding is full and not
        “empty” at the fold in the binding I trim the quilt
        according to the size of the binding. Where the finished
        binding size is not disclosed I will trim the quilt a
        generous ½” past the quilt top which allows for a ¾”
        finished binding to be applied to the quilt. The widest
        binding I have attached was 1”. The quilt was pieced by
        Shirley Keane, it looked beautiful and took a first place
        ribbon at the Mississauga Quilt Guild 2007 Show.</p>

        <p>Please “measure twice” to make sure you are sending
        enough binding, or that you are sending enough fabric to
        create the binding the width you want.</p>

        <h2>Other:</h2>

        <p>An additional labour charge of $25 per hour will be
        required for work such as piecing backing, repairing seams,
        squaring up backing and extensive pressing.</p>

        <h2>Taxes:</h2>

        <p>An additional 13% HST will be calculated and charged on
        the invoice.</p>
